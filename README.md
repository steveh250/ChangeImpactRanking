# ChangeImpactRanking
The purpose of this project is to develop a tool in Microsoft PowerApp to assess projects in a portfolio for their impact on the organisation. 

The PowerBI reports would then be used to review the portfolio to ensure we are doing the right projects - that the projects do not place too much of a change load on the organisation - or a single part of the organisation.

The initial version of the project is focused around projects and departments but the data model is constructed to allow (all future functionality):
 - multi-company
 - departmental hierarchies
 - portfolio scenarios
 - portfolio hierarchies
 - programs and projects


This is a BETA version - I'm happy to provide support for anyone wishing to try the application.
